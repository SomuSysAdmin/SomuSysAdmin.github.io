**inode** - An inode is a datastructure that describes a file system object such as a file or a
directory, containing both the disc block locations as well as the attributes of the file system
object. The inodes are identified by their inode number.

Consequently, for us to access the files/directories, we need to be able to provide a name
to the inodes, which are called hardlinks. A file may have more than one hardlink. Note that
each hardlink is simply a different name provided tot he same inode. Ths, all hardlinks to
the same file/directory have the same inode number. Hardlinks are one-directional only, i.e.,
the hardlink itself knows which inode it points to, but the inodes only know the total number
of hardlinks that are associated with it, and not which exact ones are pointing to it. Since
hardlinks point to some inode, they always need to stay on the same partition as the inode.

A symbolic link on the other hand, points to a hardlink instead of an inode. As such, it
has a different inode number than the one that the hardlink points to. Thus, the hardlink
and symbolic link can be on different partitions as well. It can even exist across servers.
Whenever a hardlink is deleted, however, all the symbolic links pointing to it are rendered
invalid.
