`tar` stands for Tape Archive. The command is most commonly used to make backups of files by storing them in archives. Some of the options of tar are:

|:-------|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **-c** | create        | typically has an extension of .tar                                    |
| **-t** | show contents | show contents of the archive.                                         |
| **-x** | extract       |                                                                       |
| **-z** | file          | compress the archive using gzip. Typically has an extension of `.tgz` |
| **-v** | verbose       | tell us what the utility is doing.                                    |
| **-f** | file          | option to indicate the name of the archive file.                      |
| **-C** | location      | indicates where the archive is to be extracted.                       |

```console
$ tar -cvf /root/etc.tar /etc
```

The above command creates the `etc.tar` archive in the `/root` directory and puts the contents of `/etc` in that archive. Note that the file `etc.tar` has a `.tar` extension only because we provided it, and not because Linux mandates it (unlike windows). Thus, sometimes we may run across tar archives that don’t have an extension and are hard to detect. So, in that case we use the `file` command, which tells us the type of a particular file.

```console
$ file /root/etc.tar
/root/etc.tar: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```

Note that the `.tar` archive only puts all the files of the `/etc` directory in the file `tar.etc`, but doesn’t actually compress anything. To enable compression the `-z` option of the `tar` command must be used.

```console
$ tar -czf /root/etc2.tgz /etc
```

Before extracting the contents of a tar file, we might want to see its contents, which can be done using the `-t` option of the `tar` command. NOTE: Some older versions of tar may require the `-z` option to enable working with gzip archives, even when simply using the archive and not creating it.

```console
$ tar -tvf /root/etc2.tgz
```

To actually extract the archive, we use `-x` option. To indicate the location where we want the extracted files to reside, we include the `-C` option. If this option is not present then the files will be extracted in the present directory.

```console
$ tar -xvf /root/etc2.tgz -C /tmp
```

To extract only one file from the archive, we can simply provide the name of the file at the very end.

```console
$ tar -xvf /root/etc2.tgz -C / etc/wgetrc
```

**NOTE** that in the above command, we use the relative path `etc/wgetrc` because of the fact that the archive stores a relative file path for easy extraction in any folder.
