    summary: |
        Somenath Sinha is a lowly SysAdmin in the city of Bangalore, Karnataka, India. 
        He's got a degree in Electrical Engineering from West Bengal University of Technology (Kolkata, W.B., India).
        Then he decided he liked computer better than damn generators - so he became a SysAdmin, after cracking GATE in CSE.

        He is also a film maker, musicaian and all round jack of all trades (and a master of 1?). 
        So, basically, he's pretty fun to be around. I think. Maybe.
